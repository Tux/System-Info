=head1 NAME

System::Info - Factory for system specific information objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use System::Info;

    my $si = System::Info->new;

    printf "Hostname:              %s\n", $si->host;
    printf "Number of CPU's:       %s\n", $si->ncpu;
    printf "Processor type:        %s\n", $si->cpu_type; # short
    printf "Processor description: %s\n", $si->cpu;      # long
    printf "OS and version:        %s\n", $si->os;

or

    use System::Info qw( sysinfo );
    printf "[%s]\n", sysinfo ();

or

    $ perl -MSystem::Info=si_uname -le print+si_uname

=head1 DESCRIPTION

System::Info tries to present system-related information, like number of CPU's,
architecture, OS and release related information in a system-independent way.
This releases the user of this module of the need to know if the information
comes from Windows, Linux, HP-UX, AIX, Solaris, Irix, or VMS, and if the
architecture is i386, x64, pa-risc2, or arm.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 System::Info->new

Factory method, with fallback to the information in C<< POSIX::uname () >>.

=cut

sub new {
    my $factory = shift;

    $^O =~ m/aix/i               and return System::Info::AIX->new;
    $^O =~ m/bsd|dragonfly/i     and return System::Info::BSD->new;
    $^O =~ m/cygwin/i            and return System::Info::Cygwin->new;

    $^O =~ m/mswin32|windows/i   and return System::Info::Windows->new;

    return System::Info::Generic->new;
    }

=head2 sysinfo

C<sysinfo> returns a string with C<host>, C<os> and C<cpu_type>.

=cut

sub sysinfo {
    my $si = System::Info->new;
    my @fields = $_[0]
	? qw( host os cpu ncpu cpu_type )
	: qw( host os cpu_type );
    return join " ", @{ $si }{ map "_$_" => @fields };
    } # sysinfo

=head2 sysinfo_hash

C<sysinfo_hash> returns a hash reference with basic system information, like:

  { cpu       => 'Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6820HQ CPU @ 2.70GHz (GenuineIntel 2700MHz)',
    cpu_count => '1 [8 cores]',
    cpu_cores => 8,
    cpu_type  => 'x86_64',
    distro    => 'openSUSE Tumbleweed 20171030',
    hostname  => 'foobar',
    os        => 'linux - 4.13.10-1-default [openSUSE Tumbleweed 20171030]',
    osname    => 'Linux',
    osvers    => '4.13.10-1-default'
    }

=cut

sub sysinfo_hash {
    my $si = System::Info->new;
    return {
	hostname  => $si->{_host},
	cpu       => $si->{_cpu},
	cpu_type  => $si->{_cpu_type},
	cpu_count => $si->{_ncpu},
	cpu_cores => $si->{_ncore},
	os        => $si->{_os},
	osname    => $si->{__osname},
	osvers    => $si->{__osvers},
	distro    => $si->{__distro}
		  || join " " => $si->{__osname}, $si->{__osvers},
	};
    } # sysinfo

=head2 si_uname (@args)

This class gathers most of the C<uname(1)> info, make a comparable
version. Takes almost the same arguments:

    a for all (can be omitted)
    n for nodename
    s for os name and version
    m for cpu name
    c for cpu count
    p for cpu_type

=cut

sub si_uname {
    my $si = System::Info->new;
    return $si->si_uname (@_);
    }

__END__

=head1 SEE ALSO

There are more modules that provide system and/or architectural information.

Where System::Info aims at returning the information that is useful for
bug reports, some other modules focus on a single aspect (possibly with
way more variables and methods than System::Info does supports), or are
limited to use on a specific architecture, like Windows or Linux.

Here are some of the alternatives and how to replace that code with what
System::Info offers. Not all returned values will be exactly the same.

=head2 Sys::Hostname

 use Sys::Hostname;
 say "Hostname: ", hostname;

 ->

 use System::Info;
 my $si = System::Info->new;
 say "Hostname: ", $si->host;

Sys::Hostname is a CORE module, and will always be available.

=head2 Unix::Processors

 use Unix::Processors;
 my $up = Unix::Processors->new;
 say "CPU type : ", $up->processors->[0]->type;
 say "CPU count: ", $up->max_physical;
 say "CPU cores: ", $up->max_online;
 say "CPU speed: ", $up->max_clock;

 ->

 use System::Info;
 my $si = System::Info->new;
 say "CPU type : ", $si->cpu;
 say "CPU count: ", $si->ncpu;
 say "CPU cores: ", $si->ncore;
 say "CPU speed: ", $si->cpu =~ s{^.*\b([0-9.]+)\s*[A-Z]Hz.*}{$1}r;

The number reported by max_physical is inaccurate for modern CPU's

=head2 Sys::Info

Sys::Info has a somewhat rigid configuration, which causes it to fail
installation on e.g. (modern versions of) CentOS and openSUSE Tumbleweed.

It aims at returning a complete set of information, but as I cannot
install it on openSUSE Tumbleweed, I cannot test it and show the analogies.

=head2 Sys::CPU

 use Sys::CPU;
 say "CPU type : ", Sys::CPU::cpu_type  ();
 say "CPU count: ", Sys::CPU::cpu_count ();
 say "CPU speed: ", Sys::CPU::cpu_clock ();

 ->

 use System::Info;
 my $si = System::Info->new;
 say "CPU type : ", $si->get_cpu;         # or ->cpu
 say "CPU count: ", $si->get_core_count;  # or ->ncore
 say "CPU speed: ", $si->get_cpu =~ s{^.*\b([0-9.]+)\s*[A-Z]Hz.*}{$1}r;

The speed reported by Sys::CPU is the I<current> speed, and it will change
from call to call. YMMV.

Sys::CPU is not available on CPAN anymore, but you can still get is from
BackPAN.
